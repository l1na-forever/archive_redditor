archive_redditor
================

A simple utility to archive a redditor's submissions to disk (for all of the really good NoSleep stories you don't want to become bookmarked 404s).

## Installation

To install from source, first, [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install), and then run:

    go get github.com/l1na-forever/archive_redditor

**Binary releases can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/l1na-forever/archive_redditor/releases/).**

## Usage

To archive a redditor's submissions, run the command:

    archive_redditor <username> <output directory path>

This will create the directory and populate it with text files of the following naming scheme:

    <year><month><date>_<post ID>_<username>_<post title slug>.txt

The contexts of the file will be the submission's selftext. Existing files won't be erased or overwritten.

## Status

Presently, the utility saves only selftext posts hosted on reddit.com. In the future, support may be added for archiving additional types of posts. Support may also be added for archiving off-site links (for example, archiving a user's images hosted off-site).
